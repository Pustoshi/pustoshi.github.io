				<h1 class="white">Problem</h1>
				<span class="gray">We thought our app might be useful for tourists. Tourists mostly use the subway, usually live in hotels located in the center, and travel between key points in the city. The SL app has somewhat bloated functionality, which is convenient for people who live in Stockholm. SL doesn’t show a subway-only map, but contains information about trams, boats and busses. We wanted to create an app which does only one thing, and is simple and minimalistic at the same time.</span>
